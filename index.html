        <h2><i>Manifesto</i></h2>
            <p><em>I define Industrial landscape as:</em></p>
            <p>A depiction of a landscape in which there is a very significant trace of human alteration of the landscape, either by the construction of (heavy) industry facilities or by a visible significant use industry during the landscape transformation.</p>
            <p>This site is for myself, as someone who wants to document such landscapes in my country, and for other people who are interested in  industry and its impact on its surroundings. The goal of my efforts will be to create a comprehensive work that depicts the impact of industry on the landscape we live in in the current time.</p>
            <p>The main era of heavy industry is long gone, but the facilities from that time are still part of our landscape in certain places. There are also places where the landscape has been completely altered by heavy industry, river courses have been moved, square kilometres of earth have been relocated. Although heavy industry is in decline, we still rely on it for the most part for energy, for transport. Dilapidated plants are being demolished, falling into disrepair, or being repurposed. I want to capture this condition in our landscape.</p>
            <p>But I don't want to just focus on the disappearing heavy industry. Our economy is now held together by car assembly or trade. I don't want to take pictures of automotive plants, that is repugnant to me, the current automotive industry has no heart, and I don't want to support their toxic work environment. But still, these plants are a huge part of our lives, I should try to find a way to capture them in an interesting way maybe. It's easier with trade, the backbone of it is logistics, and there are huge logistics centres everywhere now, and there's an interesting dystopian quality to their photos.</p>
        <h3>What I should do</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Heavy industry plants - foundries, mills, mines - both active and closed, but it must always be visible in the photo how it interferes with the surrounding landscape (nature/places where people live)</li>
            <li>Logistics centres</li>
            <li>VHV lines - powerlines as the only dominant feature of the landscape</li>
            <li>Large railway junctions with freight train traffic</li>
            <li>Railway overpasses or underpasses</li>
            <li>Power plants (no wind or solar though)</li>
          </ul>
        <h3>What I shouldn't do</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>visually uninteresting light industry plants</li>
            <li>passenger train services</li>
            <li>Agriculture sites</li>
          </ul>
        <h2>What form should I do</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Digital</strong> - Black and white panoramic images (if they will work as a panorama)</li>
            <li><strong>Analog</strong> - Black and white 2:3 images</li>
            <li><strong>Color</strong> - Probably not. Save the color for photos (close-ups) of objects that are abandoned or little used. The colour makes their desolation and emptiness stand out more.</li>
            <em>In black and white the object itself, set in the landscape, stands out more. There are no distractions.</em></p>
          </ul>

      <h2>Inspiration</h2>
        <h3>Industrial pohotographers:</h3>
        <ol>
          <h3><li>Josef Koudelka - The Black Triangle </h3>
            <p>The greatest Czech photographer. Seriously, check him out. I will write a section about him and his work here soon. <em>Find his other photographs on a similar theme</em></p>
            <img src = "https://frontiers-of-solitude.org/sites/default/files/large-image/tringle1.jpg">
            <p>One of his photograps from the book Black Triangle.</p>
            <h4>My notes from Black Triangle:</h4>
              <p>Centere composition - a significant element is in the centre, with complementary elements on the sides and composed to be balanced on both sides.</p>
              <p>The main subject in the vast majority of photos is landscapes and nature. That is, it shows only the influence of industry on the landscape. The industry itself is only in the background. Exception:Tušimice - power plant, Bílina quarry - large excavator.  Elsewhere the subject is a landscape, at most there is an abstract element in the foreground (e.g. a part of a machine, which cannot be identified at a glance), or littered garbage.</p>

          <h3><li><a href="http://www.viktormacha.com">Viktor Mácha</a></h3>
            <p>He photographs heavy industry around the world + See the work of his friends and also photographers he has been inspired by. Focuses only on documenting the heavy industry plants and equipment and loves it with deep passion, sees documenting of the plants and equipments as his lifelong goal. Rarely he documents the industry workers or makes industrial landscape photos. These photos are great!</p>

          <h3>Other photography work</h3>
          <ol>
            <h3><li>Vyznání Vysočině - Miroslav Matoušek</h3>
              <p>In this photobook the author depicts the beauty of Vysočina, the highlands region of Czech Republic, where I was born and have lived my whole life. Shot on black and white, mostly landscapes but also some portraits, architecture and natue close ups.</p>
              <h4>My notes from Vyznání Vysočině:</h4>
              <p>Working with the light. The hilly nature of the landscape is perfectly highlighted by the roads.</p>
              <p>Long shadows and black and white make the texture of the ground stand out (furrows, stubble, flooded fields) But it has to be bright sun and, most importantly, low enough and shot from the right angle.</p>
              <p>Hilly wavey landscapes look good in detail too, they don't have to be shot wide. The hilly nature of the landscape is perfectly highlighted by the roads. Interesting compositions in square format work well. </p>
              <p>The fact that a lot of photos have different formats does not reflect well on the coherence of the work.</p>

      <h2>General notes</h2>
        <p>What makes a photograph work? And what makes it mundane? Photo without interesting composition or captivating subject is bland. I know this sounds super basic, but it is the core of every photo. Is the subject I am shooting interesting? Is the composition interesting, pleasing, provoking?</p>
        <p>Black and white photo is unforgiving in this. You need to have great composition and interesting subject. The composition itself can be the subject. But it needs to be good and balanced. Shoot more black and white, it is unforgiving and will teach you.</p>
        <p>Do not hesitate too much when shooting. Last time in Prague you hesitated or played too much with unimportant technical aspects. If you feel it, shoot first, then play with details if you can shoot another frame. Not the other way around, cause you can miss the shot entirely and that is worse than slight unimportant imperfection! And in the end, the first frame you take of the scene is often the best anyway.</p>
        <p>It sucks being in a car, driving and seeing all the cool scenes or possible shooting locations. I can not stop and take photos, usually can't even stop to note down the interesting location. Cars are way to fast.. If you want to go througha a landscape and really appreciate it it takes time, we need to slow down, be allowed to stop, take look, deteour or trace back our steps.</p>
        <p>There is so many things I could shoot and make "good" or "nice" photos of. But do I wan't to? No. I do not want to take photos of something that I do not connect with. I also don't want to take photos of "random" things, even though they interest me and could make a good picture. I want to have deeper reason to push the shutter release I guess.. A purpose. What is my purpose? What is my purpose in photography?</p>
        <p>When in a new and unknown scene, new setting, stop. Take a look around, walk a little, OBSERVE. Find your subject, observe it, feel it. Then observe it some more. Get the vibe of the place, find the relations and patterns. Only after that you will be to SOMEWHAT capture the atmosphere of the place/event you are shooting</p>
