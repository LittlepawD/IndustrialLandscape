          <p>What makes a photograph work? And what makes it mundane? Photo without interesting composition or captivating subject is bland. I know this sounds super basic, but it is the core of every photo. Is the subject I am shooting interesting? Is the composition interesting, pleasing, provoking?</p>
          <p>Black and white photo is unforgiving in this. You need to have great composition and interesting subject. The composition itself can be the subject. But it needs to be good and balanced. Shoot more black and white, it is unforgiving and will teach you.</p>
          <p>Do not hesitate too much when shooting. Last time in Prague you hesitated or played too much with unimportant technical aspects. If you feel it, shoot first, then play with details if you can shoot another frame. Not the other way around, cause you can miss the shot entirely and that is worse than slight unimportant imperfection! And in the end, the first frame you take of the scene is often the best anyway.</p>
          <p>It sucks being in a car, driving and seeing all the cool scenes or possible shooting locations. I can not stop and take photos, usually can't even stop to note down the interesting location. Cars are way to fast.. If you want to go througha a landscape and really appreciate it it takes time, we need to slow down, be allowed to stop, take look, deteour or trace back our steps.</p>
          <p>There is so many things I could shoot and make "good" or "nice" photos of. But do I wan't to? No. I do not want to take photos of something that I do not connect with. I also don't want to take photos of "random" things, even though they interest me and could make a good picture. I want to have deeper reason to push the shutter release I guess.. A purpose. What is my purpose? What is my purpose in photography?</p>
          <p>When in a new and unknown scene, new setting, stop. Take a look around, walk a little, OBSERVE. Find your subject, observe it, feel it. Then observe it some more. Get the vibe of the place, find the relations and patterns. Only after that you will be to SOMEWHAT capture the atmosphere of the place/event you are shooting</p> 
          <p>I really, really the photos that come out of my 135 mm Takumar lense. It was the cheapest glass I own (costing me little over â‚¬10), it's not very practical but the way it draws is just lovely. I took many of my favourite photos with it. Object in distance appear close together and the image is smooth yet with enough contrast and with lovely colours. I should use it more.</p>
