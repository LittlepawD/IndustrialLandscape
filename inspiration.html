          <h3><li>Josef Koudelka - The Black Triangle </h3>
            <p>The greatest Czech photographer. Seriously, check him out. I will write a section about him and his work here soon. <em>Find his other photographs on a similar theme</em></p>
            <img src = "https://frontiers-of-solitude.org/sites/default/files/large-image/tringle1.jpg">
            <p>One of his photograps from the book Black Triangle.</p>
            <h4>My notes from Black Triangle:</h4>
              <p>Centere composition - a significant element is in the centre, with complementary elements on the sides and composed to be balanced on both sides.</p>
              <p>The main subject in the vast majority of photos is landscapes and nature. That is, it shows only the influence of industry on the landscape. The industry itself is only in the background. Exception:Tušimice - power plant, Bílina quarry - large excavator.  Elsewhere the subject is a landscape, at most there is an abstract element in the foreground (e.g. a part of a machine, which cannot be identified at a glance), or littered garbage.</p>

          <h3><li><a href="http://www.viktormacha.com">Viktor Mácha</a></h3>
            <p>He photographs heavy industry around the world + See the work of his friends and also photographers he has been inspired by. Focuses only on documenting the heavy industry plants and equipment and loves it with deep passion, sees documenting of the plants and equipments as his lifelong goal. Rarely he documents the industry workers or makes industrial landscape photos. These photos are great!</p>

          <h3><li><a href="https://www.nickcarverphotography.com">Nick Carver</a></h3>
            <p>
              Nick Carver is a photography profesional, instructor and youtuber. He photographs on analogue on large format. He would fall mostly into the architecture photography genre. In his work he shows a certain vibe that the American Southwest has. There is a lot of photos of urban decay, and the pictures that are not of decaying subjects are of sort of urban wasteland you could say.
              There is a lot of play with light, he loves taking his pictures during dawn and capturing both the artificial and remains of natural light in one picture in a perfect balance.

            <h3><li>Vyznání Vysočině - Miroslav Matoušek</h3>
              <p>In this photobook the author depicts the beauty of Vysočina, the highlands region of Czech Republic, where I was born and have lived my whole life. Shot on black and white, mostly landscapes but also some portraits, architecture and natue close ups.</p>
              <h4>My notes from Vyznání Vysočině:</h4>
              <p>Working with the light. The hilly nature of the landscape is perfectly highlighted by the roads.</p>
              <p>Long shadows and black and white make the texture of the ground stand out (furrows, stubble, flooded fields) But it has to be bright sun and, most importantly, low enough and shot from the right angle.</p>
              <p>Hilly wavey landscapes look good in detail too, they don't have to be shot wide. The hilly nature of the landscape is perfectly highlighted by the roads. Interesting compositions in square format work well. </p>
              <p>The fact that a lot of photos have different formats does not reflect well on the coherence of the work.</p>
